* src/skiplist.cpp
  An attempt to implement skip lists, in a C++ OO way. It is still logically
  flawed which lets the implementation's find performance degenerate to O(n).
  Also, delete is missing yet.

* src/grammar_stack.cpp:
  A non-recursive version of src/grammar.cpp

* src/coll.cpp, src/grammar.cpp, src/grammar.txt:
  Two examples based on "Acclerated C++ PPbE" by Andrew Koenig. The
  grammar.cpp example is interesting in that it uses a
  #RECURSIVE_RULE/#RULES_PER_COLLECTION probability as a stop condition for
  recursions in rule sets with more than one rule.
