* src/coll.cpp, src/grammar.cpp, src/grammar.txt:
  Two examples based on "Acclerated C++ PPbE" by Andrew Koenig. The
  grammar.cpp example is interesting in that it uses a
  #RECURSIVE_RULE/#RULES_PER_COLLECTION probability as a stop condition for
  recursions in rule sets with more than one rule.
